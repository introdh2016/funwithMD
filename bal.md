##<i>Definition</i>

What is Markdown?
>At its core, Markdown is a super simple way to add formatting like headers, bold, bulleted lists, and so on to plain text. It was originally designed to be an easy alternative to HTML, and allows people to create web pages with no HTML experience—but it's also a great way to organize notes, to-do lists, and other things.

It's great for code! Take a command we learned to use in the terminal and share it. Hint: Instead of "python" or "javascript", we will use "sh" for shell.

Now, let's have some fun! 

Create another section header, give it a name, and italicize the header.

##<i>終わり</i>

I think Digital Humanities __is a necessary field of study for the digital age we currently live in.__

The biggest questions I have going into this class are:
  * How can I integrate this course into the knowledge I already have from my RHCS studies?
  * How deep in to the study of Digital Humanities can we go in an intro course?
  * Would Lauren be willing to help me figure out these answers even after the semester ends?           
   * Will Lauren be okay with me calling her Lauren instead of "Dr. Tilton"?!
