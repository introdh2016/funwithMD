It's great for code! Take a command we learned to use in the terminal and share it. Hint: Instead of "python" or "javascript", we will use "sh" for shell.

# *Digital Humanities*
I think Digital Humanities is a very interesting subject that more people should know about.

The biggest questions I have going into this class are:
* What career options do I have with this subject?
* How can digital humanities help with my other classes?
* Will this subject be valuable in ten years?
