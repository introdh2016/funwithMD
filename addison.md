Complete the following items using Markdown.

Create a section header, call it "Definition", and italicize the header.
# *Definition* 
>This is a block QUOTE BABY!!!
>Block quoteeeee



What is Markdown?
  * Google it! Then, provide a definition as a block quote.
  * Include a citation after the quote and turn it into a link. 
 
It's great for code! Take a command we learned to use in the terminal and share it. Hint: Instead of "python" or "javascript", we will use "sh" for shell.
  
 
Now, let's have some fun! 

Create another section header, give it a name, and italicize the header.

  * What are some areas of the subject we will be studying later in the year?
 * what are some things well learn in digital humanities that we can use in our daily lives
